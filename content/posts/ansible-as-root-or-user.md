While setting up some infrastructure as code (IaC) for a new project recently, I
found myself questioning a practice I've following. As I prepared my Terraform
(OpenTofu) and Ansible configurations to provision a virtual private server
(VPS), a seemingly simple question emerged: should the approach I use for my
bare metal servers be the same for cloud infrastructure?

## Introduction: The Ansible Access Dilemma

For years, my standard approach has been creating a dedicated Ansible user via
cloud-init with sudo permissions. This method follows industry best practices
and is well-documented across countless DevOps resources.

However, when provisioning single-purpose VPS instances that might remain
relatively static after initial setup, I began wondering: **is this additional
complexity always justified?** Would it be simpler and potentially even more
secure to just run Ansible as root?

After all, using root would simplify the VPS configuration pipeline -- no need
for cloud-init user provisioning, no waiting for user creation before running
Ansible, and direct SSH key management through Terraform. But would this
convenience come at the cost of security, or could it actually reduce risk by
eliminating an additional accessible account?

This led me to consider the "provision then lock the door behind you" approach
in my infrastructure management. Let's explore both approaches to understand
their implications for different scenarios.

## Running Ansible as Root: Simplicity vs. Convention

The root approach offers immediate appeal for streamlined deployments. With
direct root access, we can eliminate several steps from our provisioning
workflow:

- No cloud-init configuration for user creation
- No potential race conditions where Ansible runs before user setup completes
- Simpler SSH key management via Terraform
- Fewer moving parts in the overall automation pipeline

Additionally, when working with ephemeral infrastructure like single-purpose,
short-lived VPS instances, having one less account with SSH access could
theoretically reduce the attack surface.

However, this approach comes with some criticisms that warrant investigation.

### Potential Drawbacks of the Root Approach

- **Security Vulnerabilities**:

  - Violates the principle of least privilege -- a cornerstone of security
    architecture
  - Creates a single point of access with maximum system privileges
  - Increases potential impact if credentials are compromised
  - Makes it difficult to attribute actions to specific users in system logs

- **Operational Risks**:

  - Removes safeguards against destructive operations
  - Increases the potential consequences of playbook errors or typos
  - Eliminates permission-based verification before critical system changes
  - Makes it easier to accidentally impact system stability

- **Poor Compliance Alignment**:

  - Conflicts with requirements in most security frameworks and compliance
    standards
  - Creates challenges for audit trails in regulated environments
  - Represents a deviation from established industry best practices

### A Closer Look at These Concerns

I would argue that these concerns are overstated. After all, a typical Ansible
user is generally configured with passwordless sudo access to everything,
essentially making it equivalent to root from a permission perspective.

Similarly, from an audit perspective, all actions would be logged under a single
user (either root or the Ansible user), so the traceability argument might seem
weak at first glance.

When following the "provision then lock" approach -- where root SSH access is
disabled after initial configuration -- the security differences might appear
even less significant.

So, is the dedicated Ansible user just unnecessary complexity? Not exactly.

## The Case for a Dedicated Ansible User

While a dedicated Ansible user might seem like added complexity for minimal
security gain, there are several compelling reasons to maintain this separation
of concerns, particularly in specific contexts.

### Benefits Beyond Simple Permission Differences

Even when the Ansible user has sudo privileges, maintaining this separation
provides important benefits:

- **Alignment with Security Principles**: Separating accounts by function
  reflects fundamental security design, establishing patterns that scale better
  as infrastructure grows.

- **Operational Clarity**: Having distinct users for distinct functions improves
  system organization and makes intentions clearer.

- **Groundwork for Future Refinement**: Starting with separated users makes it
  easier to implement more granular permissions later without architectural
  changes.

- **Consistent Practices**: Following standard practices makes your
  infrastructure more approachable for team members and ensures compatibility
  with common security tools and auditing processes.

### Long-term Infrastructure Considerations

For servers that will have extended lifecycles and require ongoing management,
the dedicated Ansible user becomes even more valuable. In these cases,
maintaining persistent root access would be a significant security liability,
making the separate user approach essential.

## Finding a Pragmatic Middle Ground

After careful consideration, I've realized this isn't necessarily an either/or
decision. Context matters significantly, and different infrastructure may
warrant different approaches.

### For Ephemeral Infrastructure

Truly ephemeral VPS instances -- those serving single purposes with short
lifecycles that are regularly rebuilt -- may benefit from the simplicity of the
root approach. In these cases, you can:

1. Perform initial provisioning as root
2. Configure and harden all services
3. Disable root SSH access as the final step
4. Implement application-specific service accounts for any ongoing processes

This "provision and lock" method can work well for infrastructure that changes
primarily through complete rebuilds rather than ongoing maintenance.

### For Persistent Infrastructure

For long-lived servers that require regular updates, maintenance, and evolution,
the dedicated Ansible user remains the superior approach. These environments
benefit from:

- **Scalable Permission Models**: Start with broad permissions, then refine as
  operational patterns emerge
- **Team-Friendly Architecture**: Support multiple administrators with clear
  access patterns
- **Reduced Operational Risk**: Maintain safeguards during iterative changes
- **Better Auditability**: Separate automated from manual administrative actions

## The "Lock Behind You" Security Pattern

Regardless of which approach you choose, implementing the "provision then lock"
security pattern is essential. This approach involves:

1. Using privileged access for initial setup and configuration
2. Implementing comprehensive security measures and service configurations
3. Hardening SSH access through key-only authentication, non-standard ports, and
   IP restrictions
4. Removing or severely restricting the initial privileged access paths
5. Establishing narrow, purpose-specific access for future maintenance

While this pattern works with either approach, it tends to integrate more
naturally with the dedicated user model, particularly for infrastructure that
requires ongoing management.

## Context-Sensitive Recommendations

After analyzing both approaches in various scenarios, here are my practical
recommendations:

### For Ephemeral, Single-Purpose VPS Deployments

- The root approach can be justified when simplicity and rapid deployment are
  priorities
- Ensure proper "lock behind you" procedures are automated as part of the
  provisioning
- Document your reasoning for deviating from standard practice
- Consider the lifecycle -- if there's any chance the "temporary" server might
  become permanent, use the dedicated user approach

### For Persistent, Long-Lived Infrastructure

- Implement the dedicated Ansible user approach
- Develop standardized cloud-init templates to streamline the process
- Consider implementing more granular sudo permissions based on specific
  operational needs
- Ensure proper key management and rotation for the Ansible user

### For Mixed Environments

- Maintain consistent practices across similar systems where possible
- Document exceptions and their justifications clearly
- Implement comprehensive access logging regardless of approach
- Regularly review access patterns and adjust as needed

Remember that even when an Ansible user has full sudo rights, maintaining this
separation reinforces good security hygiene and keeps your infrastructure
aligned with standard practices -- making it more maintainable as your team or
infrastructure grows.

## Conclusion: Balancing Security and Practicality

The choice between root and a dedicated Ansible user isn't merely about
technical security -- it's about balancing operational efficiency with security
best practices appropriate to your specific context.

I'm still inclined to recommend the dedicated Ansible user approach for most
scenarios, as the additional setup complexity is minimal when properly
templated, and the alignment with security principles provides peace of mind.
However, I recognize that for truly ephemeral infrastructure with automated
rebuilds, the root approach can offer meaningful simplification with careful
implementation.

What matters most isn't rigidly adhering to either approach, but making
deliberate, informed choices based on your specific requirements -- and
documenting those choices for future reference.

## Final Recommendations

- **Document Your Decision Process**: Whichever approach you select, document
  your reasoning and ensure your team understands the security implications and
  rationale.

- **Standardize Where Possible**: Develop consistent practices across similar
  infrastructure to avoid confusion and operational mistakes.

- **Implement Comprehensive Monitoring**: Regardless of approach, ensure you
  have robust logging and monitoring to track all system access and changes.

- **Regular Security Reviews**: Periodically reassess your approach as your
  infrastructure evolves and security requirements change.

Remember that infrastructure security is built in layers -- how Ansible connects
to your servers is just one component of a comprehensive security posture. The
most important factor is making deliberate, informed choices rather than
defaulting to convenience without consideration.

### Where to Go From Here

If you're looking to enhance your Ansible security posture further, consider
these next steps:

- **Implement role-based access control** by creating more granular sudo
  permissions for your Ansible user based on specific task requirements. This
  addresses the audit and traceability challenges while maintaining operational
  efficiency.

- **Consider implementing bastion hosts** as secure entry points to your
  infrastructure, adding another layer of security regardless of whether you're
  using root or a dedicated user for Ansible operations.
